This traffic simulation project involves creating a detailed and functional simulation of a four-way traffic intersection using Java. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what each part of the project entails:

### Traffic Light Management
1. **Simulate Traffic Lights:**
   - Implement commands to control traffic lights (e.g., set to green, yellow, red) for each direction (north, south, east, west).
   - **CLI Command:** `set_light <direction> <color>`

2. **Light Timing:**
   - Implement commands to set the duration for each light color (e.g., green for 30 seconds).
   - **CLI Command:** `set_light_timing <color> <duration>`

### Vehicle Queue Management
1. **Add Vehicles to Queue:**
   - Implement a command to add vehicles to the queue at each intersection direction (north, south, east, west).
   - **CLI Command:** `add_vehicle <direction> <vehicle_type>`

2. **Remove Vehicles from Queue:**
   - Implement a command to remove vehicles from the queue as they pass through the intersection.
   - **CLI Command:** `remove_vehicle <direction>`

### Intersection Logic
1. **Traffic Flow Logic:**
   - Implement the logic to determine which vehicle queue moves based on the traffic light state and the order of vehicles in the queue.

2. **Emergency Vehicle Logic (Optional):**
   - Implement priority logic for emergency vehicles, allowing them to bypass regular traffic rules.

### Simulation Control
1. **Start/Stop Simulation:**
   - Implement commands to start and stop the traffic simulation.
   - **CLI Command:** `start_simulation` and `stop_simulation`

2. **Simulation Speed:**
   - Implement commands to adjust the speed of the simulation (e.g., real-time, fast-forward).
   - **CLI Command:** `set_simulation_speed <speed>`

### CLI Commands/Menu
- **set_light <direction> <color>:** Set the traffic light color for a specified direction.
- **set_light_timing <color> <duration>:** Set the duration of a specified light color.
- **add_vehicle <direction> <vehicle_type>:** Add a vehicle to the queue in a specified direction.
- **remove_vehicle <direction>:** Remove a vehicle from the queue in a specified direction.
- **start_simulation:** Start the traffic simulation.
- **stop_simulation:** Stop the traffic simulation.
- **set_simulation_speed <speed>:** Set the speed of the simulation.
- **view_queue <direction>:** View the current queue of vehicles in a specified direction.

### Suggested Roles
- **Group Lead:** Oversees the project timeline, ensures deadlines are met, and coordinates meetings.
- **Developers:** Handle the core coding tasks and integration of different parts of the codebase.
- **Application Designers:** Manage data collection, choose appropriate data structures, and ensure data accuracy and application efficiency.
- **Documentation Specialist:** Prepare the project report, documentation, and presentation materials.

By breaking down the project into these components and roles, you can tackle the tasks systematically and ensure that all aspects are covered comprehensively.
